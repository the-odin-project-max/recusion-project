# Warmup: Fibonacci
The Fibonacci Sequence, which sums each number with the one before it, is a great example of a problem that can be solved recursively.

## Assignment 1
> 1. Using iteration, write a function `fibs` which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of `8`, this function should return the array `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]`.
> 2. Now write another function fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively.

In order to run these functions you’ll need to run it from somewhere. You can run scripts from the command line using the node command installed with nodejs. You can read about the common ways to do this here.
